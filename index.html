            <h3> Decline of Mauryan Empire </h3>
        </center>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ashoka died in 232 BCE. After his death, the
                empire began to disintegrate. He was succeeded
                by weak and inefficient rulers who were unable
                to control the vast empire. </li>
               <li>In 185 BCE, the last ruler of the Mauryas. Brihadratha, was killed by Pushyamitra Sunga who founded the Sunga dynasty.</li>
